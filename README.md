# Personal-Portfolio
My personal portfolio

Here is a list of projects I have completed:

## [Iris](https://github.com/zach-chase/Personal-Portfolio/tree/main/Iris)
Obligatory data exploration, data mining, and clustering with the Iris dataset. This particular project is a combination of three smaller projects I completed and compiled into one single project. Libraries used:
* pandas
* sklearn
* autoviz

## [Wordle](https://github.com/zach-chase/Personal-Portfolio/tree/main/Wordle)
Jumping on the 2022 trend of Wordle, this project explores the basics of the word guessing game in two core ways:
1. play
* Create a game of Wordle to play, while giving suggestions of the next best word to use
2. solve
* Solve a game of Wordle by inputing your guessed word and the resulting pattern to receive a suggested word to guess

The example of running the play function is seen below.

## [PageRank Algorithm](https://github.com/zach-chase/Personal-Portfolio/blob/main/PageRank/PageRank.ipynb)
One of my very first projects in Python, this project implements the PageRank Algorithm, which was developed in 1998 by Google's founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page to rank websites. My project implements their algorithm and applys it to rank websites and NCAA Men's Basketball Teams
Libraries and skills used:
* Numpy
* Csv
* PageRank algorithm

## [Monte Carlo Integration](https://github.com/zach-chase/Personal-Portfolio/tree/main/MonteCarloIntegration)
Estimating integrals using Monte Carlo Integration
Libraries and skills used:
* Scipy
* Numpy
* Matplotlib

## [Image Segmentation](https://github.com/zach-chase/Personal-Portfolio/tree/main/ImageSegmentation)
Application of graph theory

## [Decision Tree Heart Attack](https://github.com/zach-chase/Personal-Portfolio/tree/main/Decision_Tree_Heart_Attack)
Stats project

## [PCA_LSI](https://github.com/zach-chase/Personal-Portfolio/tree/main/PCA_LSI)
This project explores the basics of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI). Here we analyze the Iris dataset and compare State of the Union addresses to determine similarity.
Libraries and skills used:
* PCA
* LSI
* Sklearn
* Scipy
* Numpy
* Matplotlib

## [Sklearn_Titanic](https://github.com/zach-chase/Personal-Portfolio/tree/main/Sklearn_Titanic)
Libraries and skills used:
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Sklearn

# Project ideas:
* Facial Recognition
* Sudoku Solver
* Fantasy Football
* Spark
* Simplex
* Titanic (sklearn guide)
* Reinforcement Learning - with snake (pygame)
* Git

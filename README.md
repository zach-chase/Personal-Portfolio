# Personal-Portfolio
My personal portfolio

Here is a list of projects I have completed:

## [PageRank Algorithm](https://github.com/zach-chase/Personal-Portfolio/blob/main/PageRank/PageRank.ipynb)
One of my very first projects in Python, this project implements the PageRank Algorithm, which was developed in 1998 by Google's founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page to rank websites. My project implements their algorithm and applys it to rank websites and NCAA Men's Basketball Teams
